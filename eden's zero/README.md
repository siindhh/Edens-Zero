As a plan to the material business, to supplant the current sticker and plastic price tag culture , with a customerâ€™s readable QR code which makes the shopping simpler and furthermore assists us with destroying the wastage of assets like papers and plastic to make sticker prices, which leads to mass amount of deforestation, promoting climate change and Major threats to wildlife includes habitat destruction, degradation, fragmentation, over-exploitation, poaching, and pollution. So, what is the solution which can prevent these at a considerable rate ? Project Eden's zero is your answer. What are we performing in project Eden's zero? Replacement of price tags and other tags with QR code. By Checking this Quick Reaction code (QR code), one will be directed to the specific web application containing the products relevant details. The process is divided into two web pages...One to input the values from the admin and store in the database with a randomly generated key. The QR code also contains the key appended to the URL. The key in the URL that points to the web application that displays the contents of the saved values. The web page displays the content from the database which is same as the key obtained from scanning the QR code... All the details of the product is displayed in this page which also has a shopping feature where you can pay online and take the product home. For the back-end we use IBM CLOUD,CLOUDANT, DB2 WAREHOUSE and NODE.JS for coding the QR-code generation. In compelling activity of QR code task, enormous utilization of plastic and paper can be cut down.
